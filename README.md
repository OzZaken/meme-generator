In JavaScript, you can define functions in two ways: as regular functions or as class methods.

Regular functions are standalone functions that are not associated with a specific object or class. They can be defined using the function keyword, or using the new arrow function syntax introduced in ECMAScript 2015. Regular functions are useful when you want to define a standalone function that can be called from anywhere in your code.

Classes, on the other hand, are templates for creating objects. They can contain methods (functions that are associated with a specific object or class) and properties (data that is associated with a specific object or class). Classes are useful when you want to define a template for creating objects with a specific structure and behavior.

So, when should you use regular functions and when should you use classes? Here are a few general guidelines:

Use regular functions when you want to define a standalone function that is not associated with a specific object or class.
Use classes when you want to define a template for creating objects with a specific structure and behavior.
That said, there is no hard and fast rule for when to use regular functions versus classes in JavaScript. In many cases, you can achieve the same result using either approach, and the choice of which to use will depend on your specific requirements and the design of your code.

Ultimately, the key is to choose the approach that best fits your needs and helps you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
